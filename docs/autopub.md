Automating the generation and publishing of periodic content on a Mac can be achieved using a combination of scripting, scheduling, and possibly some third-party tools, depending on where your content is being published (e.g., a blog, social media, etc.). Below is a general guide to help you set up an automated workflow:

### Step 1: Define the Content Generation Process

1. **Content Creation Script**: Write a script that generates the content you want to publish. This could be a simple text file, a blog post, a social media post, etc. The script could be written in Bash, Python, Ruby, or any other scripting language you're comfortable with.

   Example in Python:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import datetime

   def generate_content():
       with open('daily_post.txt', 'w') as file:
           file.write(f"Today's date is {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       generate_content()
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate_content.py
   ```

### Step 2: Automate the Publishing Process

Depending on where you are publishing, you will need to write a script to handle the publishing. Here are examples for a few platforms:

#### Publishing to a Blog (WordPress)

If you're publishing to a WordPress site, you can use the `wp-cli` tool to automate the process.

1. **Install wp-cli**:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
   chmod +x wp-cli.phar
   sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
   ```

2. **Create a Publishing Script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   POST_TITLE="Daily Update"
   POST_CONTENT=$(cat daily_post.txt)
   wp post create --post_title="${POST_TITLE}" --post_content="${POST_CONTENT}" --post_status=publish
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x publish_to_wordpress.sh
   ```

#### Publishing to Social Media (Twitter)

For Twitter, you can use the `tweepy` library in Python.

1. **Install tweepy**:
   ```bash
   pip install tweepy
   ```

2. **Create a Publishing Script**:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import tweepy

   # Twitter API credentials
   consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
   consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
   access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
   access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

   # Authenticate to Twitter
   auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   # Post content
   with open('daily_post.txt', 'r') as file:
       tweet = file.read()
       api.update_status(status=tweet)
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x publish_to_twitter.py
   ```

### Step 3: Schedule the Automation

Use `cron` to schedule your scripts to run at specific intervals.

1. **Edit the Crontab**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add a Cron Job**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Run every day at 8 AM
   0 8 * * * /path/to/generate_content.py && /path/to/publish_to_wordpress.sh
   ```

   Or for Twitter:
   ```bash
   0 8 * * * /path/to/generate_content.py && /path/to/publish_to_twitter.py
   ```

### Step 4: Test Your Automation

Before relying on the automation, test each step manually to ensure everything works as expected.

### Conclusion

This guide provides a basic framework for automating content generation and publishing on a Mac. Depending on your specific needs and platforms, you might need to adjust the scripts and tools used.
