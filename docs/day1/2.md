# GET SHIT ROLLIN'

THIS IS **HOW WE DO IT**.

## STEP 1

START BY **OPENING THE FUCKING TERMINAL**.

OR **GIVE UP** and buy an app from **[COLORTV](https://colortelevision.org)**.

### IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP

- [GRAB AN NFT](https://colortv.itch.io) AND MAKE IT YOUR PFP.
  - SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU GOT 0 FOLLOWERS
  - SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU GOT 0 HOES.

## STEP 2: MASTER THE TERMINAL

WHEN YOU OPEN TERMINAL, YOU ARE IN A **DIRECTORY**.

TO CHECK WHICH DIRECTORY, AKA **PRINT WORKING DIRECTORY** RUN:

```bash
pwd
```

TO CHECK THE CONTENTS OF YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY:

```bash
ls
```

LETS  SAY YOU WANNA MOVE INTO YOUR DESKTOP FOLDER. RUN:

```bash
cd desktop
```

CONFIRM YOU DIDN'T FUCK IT UP BY RUNNING

```bash
pwd
```
